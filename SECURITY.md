# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest stable Quelea release is monitored and supported for security
updates. Older releases / CI releases are not explicitly monitored.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you notice a vulnerability either in Quelea or the surrounding infrastructure
(repository, website, wiki, etc.) then please create a Github issue with `SECURITY`
contained within the issue name. This will alert a member of the development team
who will look into it as quickly as possible.

## Disclaimer

Remember that Quelea is provided free and open-source, as-is. While we try to make
Quelea as secure as possible and deal with any security issues as soon as possible,
we *cannot* guarantee to do so. We provide no warranty and accept no liability - this
includes any security issues, and any damage that may arise from them.
